# Assignment 7: Visualizations and Story in Tableau

In this project, I developed several visualizations and crafted a Tableau Story to convey discount-related insights effectively.

## Visualizations

1. **Line Chart for Average Discounts**  
   - Created a line chart to depict the average discount trends over time.

2. **Average Discount by Month**  
   - Visualized monthly average discounts to showcase seasonal or monthly discount patterns.

3. **Highlight Table of Discounts**  
   - Developed a highlight table to bring attention to variations in discount levels across different categories or time frames.

## Story Creation

4. **Tableau Story**  
   - Compiled the above visualizations into a cohesive Story within Tableau to illustrate discount trends and highlight areas of interest for stakeholders.

This project demonstrates skills in data visualization using Tableau, focusing on storytelling techniques to make data insights more accessible and actionable.
