# Visualizations and Story in Tableau (Part 1)

In this project, I developed several visualizations and crafted a Tableau Story to convey discount-related insights effectively.

## Visualizations

1. **Line Chart for Average Discounts**  
   - Created a line chart to depict the average discount trends over time.

2. **Average Discount by Month**  
   - Visualized monthly average discounts to showcase seasonal or monthly discount patterns.

3. **Highlight Table of Discounts**  
   - Developed a highlight table to bring attention to variations in discount levels across different categories or time frames.

## Story Creation

4. **Tableau Story**  
   - Compiled the above visualizations into a cohesive Story within Tableau to illustrate discount trends and highlight areas of interest for stakeholders.


# Superstore Discount Analysis and Visualization (Part 2)

For this in-class participation activity, I used the Superstore dataset to create an in-depth analysis of discounts, profit, and sales. This project includes three advanced visualizations that reveal key business insights through distinct color schemes and captions for clarity and engagement.

## Visualizations:
- **Pareto Chart**: Displays the cumulative impact of various categories on total sales, identifying primary sales drivers.
- **Slope Chart**: Illustrates shifts in performance metrics (e.g., sales or profit) between two periods, emphasizing significant changes.
- **Cycle Plot**: Explores monthly and seasonal trends in profit, discounts, and sales, providing a detailed view of recurring patterns.

### Files in Repository:
- `A7Starter Stories F2024.twbx`
- `Oct 16 ClassWork - Discount, Sales, Profit Analysis - Pareto Chart, Slope Chart, Cycle Plot.twbx`

Each visualization is designed to help uncover and communicate insights related to Superstoreâ€™s discount, sales, and profit performance over time.
